 deluge_poland.3.d:0 "Yesterday at 21:37 Polish Marshal and dictator Józef Piłsudski died. After his usual evening smoking a cigarette on his house’s balcony he didn’t feel well and called his servant to give him some medicine. After taking some painkillers he went to sleep on his sofa and never woke up. The cause of death is probably lung cancer caused by smoking cigarettes, but today experts are also considering heart attack. Now the country is ruled by a group of politicians and officers that try to choose a new leader. However now when the country is in chaos there is opportunity for the opposition to do something. Time will show what happens."

 deluge_poland.6.d:0 "Today morning a Sanation Emergency Council announced that the new leader is Jan Stachniuk, politician known for his neopagan nationalism combined with leftist views on the economy. This for many suprise, because he points out that Judeo-Christianity is the main enemy of Poland and Poles should come back to their roots. He also isn’t a soldier so it's the end of the military regime in Poland. For sure he will bring wind of very big changes for Poland, but only time will tell about their effectiveness."

 deluge_poland.7.d:0 "Today morning a Sanation Emergency Council announced that the new leader is Bolesław Piasecki, known as pro-Christian nationalist. However he never talks about his economic programs. Before the Marshal's coup in 1930 he was connected with ONR-Falanga. Because of this many people think that Sanation’s days come to an end and the ONR-Falanga will be a new party. Also he is not a soldier and he still gets chosen as a new leader, which ends the military regime in Poland. Time will tell what comes out of this."

 deluge_poland.20.d:0 "Several people with noble background and/or connections started to approach the anti-sanation coalition. Several of these persons are staunch monarchists, who lobbied to establish a french-style royal government for a very long time, but since the Sanation has many voices opposing Friedrich III and favour a new republican system, they came forward to seek cooperation. The leader of this monarchist coalition is Aleks Ćwiakowski, proposed a temporary alliance to the ND-PSL coalition, in exchange for keeping the king in power. If we let them in then it’s more possible that the plot succeeds, but they can be a danger later."

The radicals promised, that they won't oppose the new democratic government, in exchange they asked for several seets in the new Cabinet. Maciej Rataj seemed convinced, but Roman Dmowski was skeptical. If we invite them then it will be easier for succeeding of plot, but they can later become dangerous."

Recent events in Germany and Hungary showed him, that the radical jacobin threat is quite formidable, even within Poland. With several members of the pro-monarchist inner circle, he made precautions several years ago to flee the country if the political situation turns against the crown. Now with the death of the Marshall, His Majesty seems convinced, that there is a chance for another radical revolution. Temporarily, the royal family could go for [SWE.GetName] in disguise as a royal visit. The King either could go with his family or stay. If he leaves, he would be safe, but by leaving, he wouldn't be able to protect his position if the new regime turns against the crown."

After failure of insurrection he traveled to Switzerland where he died on 15th of October 1817. He witnessed how Napoleon I redraws borders of Europe and he was against it. He saw Napoleon as dictator that cares only about France. He was opposed to idea of creating Polish Legions in Italy, he knew that Napoleon would use them as his tools for French affairs, not cause of Polish independence. During time of Poland being dominion of France he was shown as enemy of both France and Poland in schools and media, however many knew the truth.

 deluge_poland.78.d:0 "Adam Mickiewicz is Polish, Lithuanian and Belarusian national poet. While he was young Napoleon with his Grand Army and Józef Poniatowski were marching to Russia through his village in Lithuania. He studied in Vilnius. Later when new order in Eastern Europe was established he dissatisfied and opposed to it. It diveded Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth into Ukraine, Belarus, Baltic Duchy and Poland. He thought that dividing Poland and Lithuania at that moment was bad decision, because many people thought about themselves as Polish-Lithuanians. There were many mixed families, especially in the east of the country. Many people in Lithuania still spoke Polish. He didn't think the same about Ukraine and Belarus, he pointed only that their national identity were not fully developed. He also thought that Baltic Duchy is not fully stable country, because it combined Lithuania, which at that time was closer to Poland, with Lativa, which at that time was influenced by German, Russian and Lithuania cultures, and Estonia which was closer to Northern Europe. He wanted restoration of united Poland and Lithuania and forcefull removal of the French from Eastern Europe. While he was young he was bonapartist, however later he got dissapointed with Napoleon, because of objectification of nations of Eastern Europe. Later all of his views were put in his literature. One of most famous, if not the most famous, books was "Forefathers' Eve III". It told story of prisoners and few other people in Baltic Duchy and North-Eastern Poland that met French opression and many other problems caused with organisation of Napoleon's dominions. In this book he antagonized French and Russians, however in postscript "To my friends Muscovites" he sympathized with Russians opressed by Tsar. Later in 1828 he was arrested, in 1834 sent to "exile" to France where he was in home arrest until 1837, later he could travel in France, but was constantly under surveillance by French spies. During that period he wrote many of his books. In 1842 he escaped France and travelled to Istanbul, Ottom Empire. He was welcomed there. Despite many wars between PLC and Ottomans in the past Poles were respected in Empire, because of victory at Vienna in 1683. In 1842 he met with current Sultan and became official representant of Polish political exiles. He also convinced Sultan to stop recognizing current Polish government. This hurt Ottoman-French relations. From that point of time Istanbul became main place of meeting of Polish emigration. He died there in 1856 under mysterious circumstances. It is belived that he was poisoned by French or Russian spies, but it causes much controversy. Nowadays he is considered a great poet that was creating for maintenance of resistance in Polish and Lithuania people. Some people consider him Messiah, especially because of book "Forefathers' Eve III", but also "Mister Tadeusz" and "Konrad Wallenrod". He translated many classical books to Polish. Experts say that his book "History of the Future", finished in 1842, had great influence on today's science fiction literature, some experts consider him "father" of that genre."

 deluge_poland.79.d:0 "Emilia Plater was female general of Polish-Lithuanian origin. She was born on 13th of Novemeber 1806 and died on 23th of December 1831. She started Anti-French uprising of 1844 with help of few other people like Maciej Rybiński, Józef Chłopicki or Michał Radziwiłł. She started it in Baltic Duchy, others started it in Kingdom of Poland. It's main target was independent Poland, but she also aimed to liberate Lithuania and combine it in one state with Poland. She was raised in Polish-Lithuanian family, she felt bond to both countries and both of them being disunited under French boot was unacceptable. Despite strong patriarchy in current army she became brave general in very young age. France send army to crush uprising. She died during uprising, because of being shot by French soldier while defending to her last breath. Many people consider her hero and authority for women and patriots. Many people connected year of 1844 to Messiah from book "Forfather's Eve III" by Adam Mickiewicz, so some of them think that she was the "44", the Messiah, especially that her father was Polish and mother was from foreign lineage, so it was compatible with the book. However many discredit her and deny that she was a Messiah, because she was a woman. Nowadays many just don't belive in myth of 44, but still think that Emili Plater is role model for many young people, especially women."

He also was Polish and French general, minister of war and commander-in-chief of the troops of Duchy of Warsaw and later Polish Kingdom. He was only Pole to be titled Marshal of France. He was born in Wien on 7th May 1763. He spent his childhood in Austria where he was being raised to be general or musician. After he became general he still he carried keyboards to the battlefield. In 1778 he took part in Austro-Turkish war, then he saved prince Karl Philipp Schwarzenberg, who later during Napoleonic wars became his enemy. He was raised by cosmopolitic aristoracy and the only person that saved him from becoming Austrian was his uncle, king of Poland, Stanisław August Poniatowski. After war of 1778 he joined Polish miliatry and helped enact Constitution of 3rd May. By joining Polish military he lost all of his contacts in Wien and respect from his childhood friends. In Polish-Russian war of 1792 he turned out to be a great general. He was dissapointed by uncle's decision to cooperate with Russian Tsaritsa Catherine the Great. He wanted to fight with partitioners until his last breath. After lost war he escaped to Wien, when he tried to challenge to a duel main Polish collaborator, from Tagrowica, Stanisław Szczęsny Potocki. After king Stanisław Poniatowski, his uncle, joined Targowica, Józef sent his orders gained in Polish military back to the king. After start of Kościuszko's insurrection he joined it. After failure of insurrection he changed his place of living few times and finally stopped at Warsaw that was incorporated intro Prussia. Until 1906 he led a dissolute lifestyle, never married, had many lovers and 2 unlegitimate sons. In 1906 when Joachim Murat entered Warsaw he looked for leader of new Polish army. First candidate was Jan Henryk Dąbrowski, but Joachim decided that he doesn't have enough experience and contacts. Józef Wybicki proposed Józef Poniatowski, who became the minister of war of Duchy of Warsaw and one of Napoleon's generals. He led armies in war with Austria for Galicia, helped Napoleon with conquest of Moscow and became respected and trusted by Napoleon and his other generals. He demanded and brought about that the posts of voyts should be granted to peasants, and not to the local nobility, as was customary. He argued that the courts should be obliged to uniformly apply the more progressive Napoleonic code, and not, at their discretion, also the former Constitution of May 3 or Prussian law, in order to avoid arbitrariness in judicial decisions. He co-founded the Warsaw Medical School, which in 1816 became part of the University of Warsaw. He defended Jews removed by the authorities from the main streets of Warsaw. Persuaded by the elders of the Jewish community that young Jewish conscripts should have the opportunity to observe their religious duties in the army, seeing no way to reconcile this with military practice and discipline, he decided to exempt them from conscription. He died in 1823 because of unidentified illness, propably caused by old battle wounds. Many of French high-ranked officials arrived at his funeral. Today he is a symbol of Polish revival, reborn and willpower, as well as main hero of Napoleonic wars."
