 POL_Pilsudski_desc:0 "Józef Piłsudski of the Piłsudski coat of arms was born on December 5, 1867 in Zułów in the Vilnius region, which is located in Belarus, in a family with Polish patriotic traditions. Father, Józef Wincenty, was an important state official, mother - Maria née Billewicz - came from a well-known noble family of the Mogiła coat of arms. His parents moved to Poland when he was young, to Białystok in Podlasie.\n\nA year after his mother died, he graduated from Warsaw University (1885), where he was active in socialist and nationalist organizations against the monarchy. After graduation, he joined the army. On March 22, 1887, he was arrested for activities against the king, but he was released a year and a half later. In 1899, Piłsudski married Maria Juszkiewicz née Koplewska, an activist of the Polish Socialist Party, called "Beautiful Lady" by party members. After the old King Jerzy I died, the oppression slowly faded away, so Piłsudski focused on a military career and began to advocate more nationalist slogans.\n\nWhen the Great War broke out, he was already promoted to the rank of Marshal and commanded the armies on the front with Westphalia, where he got to know Edward Rydz-Śmigły. Despite his and Śmigły's efforts, the war was lost. Józef Piłsudski was devastated. He started to doubt existance of God. Over the following years, until 1930, he watched his country collapse due to ineffective socialist rule (PSL-PPS coalition) and the effects of the Treaty of Versailles. At that time, he preached revanchist slogans.\n\nIn 1930, as a high-ranking soldier, marshal and symbol of revenge, he introduced a state of emergency with the help of extreme right-wing and monarchist politicians, as well as loyal soldiers. From that moment, he introduced the program of "Sanation" of society, which mean healing it from all vices. His rule was a combination of totalitarianism, nationalism and socialism. He forced atheism, cult of personality, set up many labor camps for his political opponents, started to militarize Polish society and established many surveillance tools. King Fryderyk I did not try to oppose this government, he just submitted to them, maybe because he also wanted to make revenge on enemies, which except destroying Poland, also killed his wife Luise. At present, Piłsudski continues his rehabilitation program, although his health is deteriorating..."

 POL_Smigly_desc:0 "He was born in Brzeżany on March 11, 1886. His father was Tomasz Rydz, his mother was Maria née Babiak. The Rydz family comes from the impoverished nobility or from the peasantry. Tomasz Rydz died when Edward was 2 years old, and his mother died when the boy was 10 years old. He was taken care of by his grandfather, Jan Babiak (who was a poor man who worked as a laborer in a slaughterhouse). A little later, the Uranowicz family, an intelligentsia family, took care of the child. Thanks to their support, Edward was able to go to school. He attended the Higher Gymnasium in Brzeżany, where he graduated in 1905 as Edward Rydz. During this time he became interested in social and political thought. He was also known as a talented draftsman, sketching mainly landscapes. At the end of his secondary school education, he joined the socialist youth organization "Promień". He later found himself in "Rebirth". It was an organization that under King George I was anti-monarchist, then when Frederick I took power changed direction to nationalism.\n\nAfter graduating from high school and passing his final exams, he began his studies at the Academy of Fine Arts in Kraków. In 1908, he decided to devote his artistic career to political and military activities. For this reason, he interrupted his studies at the Academy of Fine Arts and moved to the Military Academy in Warsaw. In 1912 he graduated from this academy with honors. In 1913 he returned to his interrupted studies at the Academy of Fine Arts, which he graduated a year later. While studying at the Academy in Warsaw, he became acquainted with Józef Piłsudski and slowly absorbed his views. He also became interested in aviation and became a pilot, became football fan, he played with other soldiers in freetime. This resulted in knowing importance of not yet advanced air warfare.\n\nAt the beginning of the Great War he was promoted to the rank of Marshal and served with Józef Piłsudski on the Westphalian front. His orders and actions resulting from them were considered cruel or aggressive. Piłsudski described him as good soldier and commander, quiet, modest, hardworking and many other good traits. Many of his closer workers and comrades said that he hides his true nature under a mask. They described him as egoistic, narcissistic and cowardly inside.\n\nAfter the war he was crushed by the weight of defeat. He joined Piłsudski's activities promoting nationalism and revanchism. He also decided to change and stop being internal coward or an egoist for the sake of Poland and revenge. In 1925, after the entry into force of the law enabling the surname to be supplemented with a pseudonym adopted during military service, Edward Rydz, who from 1923 also used the pseudonym "Śmigły", changed his name to "Rydz-Śmigły". Over time, he became more radical than Piłsudski himself, and yet he claims that he will only continue his rule when the need arises..."
 POL_Character_deluge_Sikorski:0 "Владислав Сикорский"
 POL_deluge_Sikorski_desc:0 "He was born on May 20, 1881 in Tuszów Narodowy. Władysław had an older brother Stanisław and two sisters: Eugenia and Helena. The father died in 1885 and since then the family was supported by the mother, who sewed and delivered postal items. From 1898 to 1902 he attended a teachers' seminar in Rzeszów. After drawing attention to himself with his talents for learning, he lived in the house of the headmaster of this school, Julian Zubczewski, and after his transfer to Lviv, together with the professor's family, he moved to this city and continued his education in the local Gymnasium from 1899. There he passed his secondary school-leaving examination. In 1902, he began his studies at the Faculty of Road and Bridge Engineering at the Lviv Polytechnic, where he became involved in patriotic and social activities. After graduation, he was employed in the Galician administration, dealing with matters related to the oil industry. In 1909, he married Helena Zubczewska, the adopted daughter of Julian Zubczewski, and lived successively in Leżajsk, Nisko and Radomyśl, where as an engineer he carried out measurement works on the regulation of the San River.\n\nBefore the outbreak of the Great War, he obtained an officer's diploma at a military school and became a second lieutenant in the reserve of the Polish Army. In 1907 he became close to the Polish Socialist Party (PPS), then one of the main pro-independence groups. At that time, he met Józef Piłsudski. Having a thorough military education, Sikorski taught other party members, introducing them to issues related to the art of war. He was one of the co-founders and members of Polish anti-monarchist organizations during George the I: the Union of Active Struggle and the Riflemen's Union. By the time of the Great War, he became a marshal. During the Great War, he served on the front with Austria, where he was respected by the soldiers for his concern for human resources and thoughtful actions focused on solving problems as bloodlessly as possible.\n\nAfter the Great War he was devastated by the loss, he believed it was partly his fault. There was an internal conflict in him - on the one hand, he is proud that he cared for the lives of soldiers during the war, on the other hand, if he had not done so, maybe the offensive would have gone further and, combined with the efforts of Piłsudski and Rydz-Śmigły, the war could have been won. Sikorski believes in democratic and libertarian ideals, but the defeat in the Great War influenced him to take a more revanchist and nationalistic approach.\n\nIn 1930, despite major ideological contradictions with Józef Piłsudski, he managed to gain a lot of power in the government of Sanacja. Since then, he has been working for Poland, but also for the slow liberalization and democratization of the country."

The name "Zadruga" came from the term of an old Slavic tribal community. He was also the author of the book "History Without History", which was an analysis of the causes of Poland's historical decline, for which he blamed Catholicism and the Jesuit Counter-Reformation in Poland. He created a nationalist and at the same time anti-capitalist ideology, which rejected Christianity because of its destructive influence on the national character, partly due to foreign (Jewish) origin, and called for the creation of a collective society - the "National Creating Community".\n\nIn 1935 he moved to Warsaw with Sabina Różycka, his then life companion.

For some time he stayed in Uście Solne. Later, he moved to Lwów, where he studied at the 4th Gymnasium and there in June 1904 he passed his final exams with distinction.

During his studies, he conducted educational and political activities in peasant circles. He was active in the Society of the People's School of Tadeusz Kościuszko and Brotherly Help. At the end of his education at the University of Lviv, he became a member of the Representative Committee of the Union of Progressive Youth. He graduated in 1908, after which he became a gymnasium teacher. From 1908 to 1918 he taught Latin at the VI Junior High School in Lviv. In 1918, he became a teacher at the gymnasium in Zamość. At that time, he found himself in the environment associated with "Kurier Lwowski". At that time, he met and collaborated with the activists of the Polish People's Party. In 1909 he married Bolesława Wiczyńska. The difficult financial situation soon forced him to accept a job offer as a private tutor. In 1913, there was a split in the peasant movement, and Maciej Rataj joined the PSL in 1914. Five years later he came to Zamość, where he became a classical philology teacher at a local school. On his initiative, "Gazeta Zamojska" was founded there. PSL structures were not developed in the vicinity of Zamość at that time. However, the Polish Military Organization (POW) was strong.

In 1918 he organized a large pro-agrarian demonstration and some other events.\n\nAfter the elections in 1925, Rataj entered the Sejm (1st term). At the second sitting, on December 1, he was elected Speaker of the Sejm. He was voted for by the centrist and right-wing parties of the PSL party. This function was extremely difficult and responsible at that time due to the large party split in the chamber. In a relatively short time, Maciej Rataj turned out to be an efficient organizer of the work of the Sejm, earning him the universal respect of the majority of the members of the chamber. On March 26, 1928, he ended his activity as the Marshal of the Sejm. His successor was Ignacy Daszyński. Since the May coup, his assessment of the marshal had gradually deteriorated.

 POL_deluge_ulam_desc:0 "He was born on April 13, 1909 in Lviv. Born into a wealthy, assimilated Jewish family, he showed outstanding abilities as a child. His father, Józef Ulam, was a lawyer born in Lviv, his mother Anna Auerbach was born in Stryj. The father was a staff officer in the Polish army, so the family traveled frequently. Because of his travels, he had only private tutors. In 1918 the family returned to Lviv. In 1919 he passed the entrance exams to the gymnasium. He was "a Friday student except in calligraphy and drawing." In 1927 he passed three-day matriculation examinations. His father wanted him to become a lawyer and take over his office, but he realized that Stanisław "has no talent in this field". After graduating from high school, at the insistence of his family, he decided to start engineering studies at the General Faculty of the Lviv Polytechnic. During his studies, however, he devoted more attention to attending mathematics seminars than engineering courses. At the age of twenty, he published his first paper, which dealt with the arithmetic of cardinal numbers.\n\nBefore the end of his first year of studies, he wrote his second thesis, which he published in "Fundamenta". Eventually, he graduated as a mathematician. In 1933 he defended his doctorate, the work was published by "Ossolineum". Already during his studies, he became an important figure in the very thriving community of Lviv mathematicians.\n\nRecently, thanks to the subsidy of the Lviv University by the government, he began working for it on nuclear research."
